                    <h2>HOW TO MAKE MAKEUP LAST ALL DAY</h2>
                    <p>Whether you are going for a more natural makeup look for the daytime or a more dramatic look for the evening, why not make it count? Below are some tips and tricks to help make sure your face makeup lasts as long as possible.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The most important and basic step in making your makeup last long and sit beautifully on your skin is to know your skin type. Different skin types are suited for different kinds of products.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>For example––with oily skin a matte foundation may be ideal, but it wouldn’t sit well on dry skin. When you know your skin type, you have a better chance of choosing the right makeup product. When you apply the right makeup product, half of your work is already done!</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Once you know your skin type and any issues you face, you’re better able to prepare your skin for makeup. The first step is obviously cleansing. Choose the right cleanser for your skin and then move on to an exfoliator.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Additionally, a hyaluronic acid serum is your best friend when it comes to skincare, although any hydrating product will do in a pinch. Don’t forget to use moisturizer and sunscreen as well. All of these steps help contribute to the longevity of your makeup.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Once your skincare routine is done, you can move on to priming your skin. Primers are makeup products designed to provide a solid base for your foundation to latch onto. They are generally lightweight and gel-like.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Primers come in a variety of formulations, from hydrating and nourishing primers to mattifying or dewy ones. Choose the primer that best suits your makeup and skincare needs. For example––if you have oily skin, you should choose a mattifying primer to ensure the makeup doesn’t slide off from the excess oil.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Knowing your skin type is also the first step in finding the right foundation. When your foundation is uniquely designed for your skin type, it has more of a chance of staying put for longer. Choose a matte or semi-matte foundation for oily skin, and a dewy or sheer foundation for dry skin.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Once your foundation is applied, set it using a translucent setting powder. Setting powders are also available in a variety of finishes, from matte to dewy or sheer ones. Choose the one that best suits you. The powder will set cream or liquid foundation formulas and help them stay in place longer.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>If you’re using a cream blush or bronzer, set it with a matching powder product. The same goes if you are using a cream based product to create the look of faux freckles. As with foundation and setting powder, the powder blush or bronzer will help the cream products last longer.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Sensing a trend here? For eye makeup, you need to prime your eyes just like the rest of your face. However, you may need to use a separate primer for that.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Layering your eye makeup properly is key too, with cream or liquid products at the base and powder on top. As an additional step to ensure your eye makeup lasts, you can dip the makeup brush in a setting spray before dabbing it onto the eye makeup palette.
